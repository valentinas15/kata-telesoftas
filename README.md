save time, you can communicate your ideas using pseudo code, diagrams or comments.
We recommend leaving output formatting intact.
Additional requirements:

- Application type â€“ console application or a class covered with tests.
- Use OOP/FP, SOLID, KISS, DRY principles as much as possible in your solution.
- Algorithm correctness must be ensured by covering it with automated unit tests.
- Source code should be provided in a public repository (github.com, bitbucket.org, etc.)

- Comment shortcuts you take when you have an idea for better implementation.
- Don't hesitate to use new language features where it makes sense.
